1. Each player has three lives per level
2. Players lose lives when the ball goes past their paddles and off their respective side
3. Players can hit powerups, which are active for at most 5 seconds. Hitting two powerups in < 5 second succession will override the 
first powerup and activate the second one. The most recently activated powerup will appear on your status display
4. Down to your last life? You are granted a special paddle ability
5. Lost all of your lives? The surviving player wins that level
6. The levels will get harder: the ball will move faster, the paddles will get smaller, and there will be less time in between
powerups because there will be more on the screen at once
7. Whoever has the most wins out of all three levels is the victor!
